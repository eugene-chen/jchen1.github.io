The many activites colleges offer can easily overwhelm you if you are not prepared. Athletics (varsity or intramural), clubs, Greek life, drugs, side projects and startups, parties, research, and classes will all clamor for your attention. Here are some tips I wish somebody had told me before entering college:

## Prioritize

Prioritize activities that are important to you. If you dream of being the starting power forward on your basketball team, don't risk injury by joining the parkour club. If you want to be a Putnam Fellow, don't get blackout drunk every weekend. Your first priority should be your mental health and happiness --- if you're not happy, make a change. Don't get sucked in by any one activity or try to participate in too many. Instead, pick a small set of interests to focus on. Don't be afraid to drop activities. You're not in high school anymore --- you don't need to hold inflated titles in multiple clubs anymore. 

## Learn efficiently

Pay attention in class --- or don't attend at all. Don't waste time in a lecture hall if you're going to be sending selfies or falling asleep. Aim to finish homeworks a day in advance. Don't study if you don't need to. I like to take the first midterm of a class without preparation. If I do well, then I won't prepare for the remaining exams. Otherwise, I'll take the time to study.

When you do study, study efficiently: don't deprive yourself of sleep by excessively studying. Go to office hours. Take practice exams instead of just looking at the answer keys or trying to absorb the entire textbook.

## Chill out

College is *hard*. If you're not planning on attending graduate school, don't stress out about every grade. Making a 4.0 is less important than retaining your sanity. Maintaining your body with sleep and exercise is more important than bumping your homework grade by a couple points. 

## Stay healthy

Although the freshman 15 may be a myth (link), unlimited dining hall food adds up over four years. Buy a cheap scale and weigh yourself at least weekly. Then, adjust your eating and exercise habits appropriately. Some easy dietary adjustments include replacing candy with fruit, diet soda for regular soda, and black coffee for your daily Starbucks® Caramel Cocoa Cluster Frappucinno® Blended Coffee Beverage[TODO: get sidenotes working].

The average college student sleeps [6-6.9 hours a night](https://www.uhs.uga.edu/sleep/), but needs 7-9. You don't need me to reiterate the risks of sleep deprivation. Make sure you sleep enough, and maintain proper [sleep hygeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_hygiene). Importantly, [avoid going to sleep too late at night](http://www.quora.com/Is-it-bad-to-fall-sleep-late-ex-midnight-but-wake-up-late-like-10-00-am), even if you get ten hours of sleep when you do.

Decide for yourself whether the consequences of drinking and drugs[TODO: LINK] outweigh their benefits. As always, moderation is key: for example, drink, but don't black out, and only on weekends. Use weed, but save your lungs and only eat pot brownies[TODO: link to lung damage].
 
Join at least one group physical activity (intramural sports and clubs, for example), and make it a priority. In the words of Socrates: *"No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable."*

## Romance

Relationships are hard in a vacuum. Add in all of the stresses of college, and they can be almost impossible. Long distance relationships are particularly thorny --- if you think you'll stay with your high school sweetheart who's a thousand miles away, you're probably wrong(TODO: 538 link). Do not become codependent on your partner. Make sure you both continue to hang out with your separate groups of friends. [TODO: flesh out]
