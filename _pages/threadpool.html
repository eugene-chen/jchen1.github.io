<p>A lightweight header-only threadpool library for C++11. Offers more control than <code>std::async</code> while remaining simpler than manual thread management. <code>threadpool</code> can automatically allocate and deallocate threads as necessary, handles any callable object (including lambdas and function objects), and supports <code>std::future</code>.
