<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and I'm living in San Francisco right now. I studied computer science with a minor in human-computer interaction at <a href='http://cmu.edu' target='_blank'>Carnegie Mellon University</a>, and graduated in 2016. I'll be joining <a href='http://blendlabs.com' target='_blank'>Blend Labs</a> in mid-July.</p>

<p>Since everyone asks eventually, I have <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia_universalis' target='_blank'>alopecia areata universalis</a>, so I'm (almost) completely hairless. Yes, even there.
</p>

<p>I ran track for <strong>12</strong> years, but I've hung up my spikes for good. I was a captain on the CMU track team and hold the <a href='http://athletics.cmu.edu/sports/mtrack/history/records' target='_blank'>60 meter school record</a>.
